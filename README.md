A Chatgpt clone is a conversational AI platform that is modeled after ChatGPT, the popular chatbot developed by Anthropic. It utilizes natural language processing and machine learning to have human-like conversations and provide useful information to users.

Just like ChatGPT, a <a href="https://zipprr.com/chatgpt-clone/">Chatgpt clone script</a> can understand natural language questions and provide detailed answers on a wide range of topics.
